# Networked Two-player Blackjack

## Overview

Our code is a two-player networked Blackjack game. Each player starts with \$2000 and is able to make various bets in intervals ranging from \$25 to \$1000. The game ends when one player runs out of money. Both players play against the dealer, and as in real life, both players can see each other’s cards as well as one of the dealer's. The dealer draws until it reaches at least 17, as is the standard in some casinos.

## How to Run

To run the code, you need to use the desktop version of VS Code (it won’t run in the browser). You then need to run the server and client code in separate terminals. To play the next round after you’ve won or lost, just select your desired amount and place another bet. The game ends when a player runs out of money.

- Utilized ChatGPT and Claude AI for assistance in developing some of the code infrastructure for the GUI, which we then built upon and customized extensively.
- GUI creation was aided by this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI9LXzo0UY0).
- Some of the key game mechanisms—such as updating the game screen, switching between players, and handling card drawing—were also developed using generative AI.
