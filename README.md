Our code is a two-player networked blackjack game. Each player starts with 2000$ and is able to make various bets in various intervals ranging from 25$ to 1000$. The game ends when one player runs out of money. Both players play against the dealer, and as in real life, both players can see each other’s cards as well as one of the dealers. The dealer draws until it reaches at least 17, as is the standard in some casinos. 
To run the code, you need to do so on the desktop version of VS Code because it won’t run in the browser. You then need to run the server and client code in separate terminals. To play the next round after you’ve won or lost, you just select your desired amount and place another bet. The game ends when a player runs out of money.

Utilized ChatGPT and Claude AI, which helped provide some of the code infrastructure for the GUI, which we then built upon and customized a lot. Also, the GUI was created with information from this YouTube tutorial. Linked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI9LXzo0UY0. We also used the generative AI to develop some of the key game mechanisms, most significantly updating the game screen, switching between players,  and the card drawing mechanisms. We also used online Python resources such as W3 Schools and GeeksforGeeks.
